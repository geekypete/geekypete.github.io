				<h2>The <strong>problem</strong> </h2>
       <p> Every year, more than 5 million patients in the U.S. undergo biopsy procedures
        to get definitive diagnoses. The goal of the biopsy procedure is to get a sample
        that is representative of the suspected area. However, 1 in 5 patients have to
        get repeat procedures because the biopsies were not representative of the
        suspected area. Most biopsy procedures incorporate a rapid on- site evaluation
        (ROSE) technique for quality assurance of the sample. However, the current ROSE
        does not give a clear picture of the quality of biopsy because the technique
        only allows evaluation of less than 1% of the cells that have “fallen off” of
        the biopsy. As a result, ROSE is inaccurate 20% of the time, leading to costly
        and painful repeat procedures. Furthermore, ROSE depletes DNA content from the
        biopsies, impacting downstream molecular analysis and genetic sequencing.
        Specialized pathology personnel must be physically present to perform time-
        consuming and complicated steps for ROSE. Physicians need a more accurate and
           efficient tool to perform ROSE for quality assurance of biopsy samples </p>

				<h2>The <strong>solution:</strong> the I200 microscopy system</h2>
        <p>Instapath has engineered the I200 microscopy system to image intact
        biopsy samples without fixation, using simple fluorescent stains. The
        I200 renders digital images of biopsies within seconds of removal,
        enabling a more efficient workflow for performing rapid on-site
        evaluation (ROSE). Instapath also features centralized telepathology
        evaluation over a secure network, thereby increasing the productivity of
        highly specialized pathologists and technicians. Utilizing the I200 for
        ROSE increases the throughput of biopsy procedures and allows more
        patients to be treated per biopsy suite per day.</p>

        <p>The I200 is a structured illumination microscopy (SIM) system
        optimally configured for clinical applications such as ex vivo biopsy
        imaging for ROSE. SIM works by optically sectioning fresh tissue to
        generate subcellular (1.3 micron) images of the intact tissue with high
        contrast. Fluorescent stains that do not affect downstream histology
        processing illuminate important pathological features. The frame rate of
        the I200 is 33 fps, meaning a typical biopsy takes less than 30 seconds
        to completely image. All images can be reviewed remotely via a zoomable
        interface.</p>
